<h1>Hi, I'm Steve. A Full Stack Software Engineer</h1>
<p>I have been writing code for over <strong>10 years</strong>. I Started with <strong>HTML</strong>,<strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>; then I moved on to creating dynamic pages with <strong>PHP</strong>. I taught myself <strong>PHP</strong> by following tutorials and reading other developer's code, In my early years I was a programmer. However, once I discovered the concept of software engineering, I quickly adopted better ways of developing software and vowed to evolve from a programmer to an engineer.</p>
<p>During my time studying in university, I started a small business(LLC) developing <strong>websites</strong> and <strong>applications</strong> for local companies in Southern California. I learned a lot about interfacing with customers, contract writing and <strong>agile development</strong> during this time. I interned with a few organizations until finally settling at California Steel Industries.</p>
<p>While working for California Steel Industries, I continued to learn and absorb everything. I created Human Machine Interfaces, cleaned up their code base, relieving the organization of much of their technical debt, and converted programs from <strong>C</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, and <strong>VB</strong> to <strong>C#</strong>. I was offered a full time position before graduating from college and accepted. I quickly became their top developer, mentoring not only junior and intern process control engineers, but also giving design advice to the senior engineers.</p>
<p>I've spent most of my time working on <strong>web applications</strong>. I enjoy working with <strong>web applications</strong> because often times the developer gets to work on all aspects of the project. From the <strong>front-end</strong> to the <strong>back-end</strong> and also the <strong>database</strong>. I consider myself a <strong>full stack developer</strong>. I also enjoy going from conception to implementation very rapidly. I like to stub out ideas and create prototypes. Making progress on problems greatly increases my motivation and enthusiasm. However, although my experience in <strong>web application development</strong> is most prevalent; I genuinely just enjoy <strong>software development</strong> in general.</p>
<p>My approach to <strong>software development</strong> is pretty simple. Write code in as simple of a manner as possible, but not any simpler. While in college I would have family members read my code (they were not techies like me) and ask them if it was clear what my program or software was doing. I took pride in the fact that lay people were able to understand my source code. I didn't expect them to understand some of the algorithms that I was using, but I commented on parts that were not easily identifiable, created semantic names for variable, functions and classes, and logically structured code in groups. These things seem fundamental, but I am surprised by how often I don't see this approach used in practice. In essence I try to follow a few core principles:</p> 
<ol>
    <li><b>Do it right the first time.</b></li>
    <li><b>Make it easy to follow!</b></li>
    <li><b>Be pragmatic.</b></li>
    <li><b>Have Fun!</b></li>
</ol>
